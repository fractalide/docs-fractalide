= Registering your stake

Without a stake key you cannot participate in the consensus process. Generating this key allows one to have a place for their funds, participate in the protocol, claim stake, reap rewards and if one desires, setup a stakepool.

This key pair identifies you as a potential stake owner.

== You stake key pair

It is preferable to use a key pair that is different from
your wallet (for security reason). See the [`jcli key`] documentation
to generate a new key pair of type `Ed25519` or `Ed25519Extended`. For example:

[source, bash]
----
$ jcli key generate --type=Ed25519Extended > stake_key.prv
----

The file `stake_key.prv` will contain your private key.

[source, bash]
----
$ cat stake_key.prv | jcli key to-public > stake_key.pub
----

The file `stake_key.pub` will contain your public key.
