= The genesis file for your permissioned network

The genesis file is the file that allows you to create a new blockchain
from block 0. It lays out the different parameter of your blockchain:
the initial utxo, the start time, the slot duration time, etc...

Example of a BFT genesis file with an initial address UTxO and an account UTxO.
More info regarding link:/httyj/#_starting_a_bft_node[starting a BFT blockchain here]
and link:/httyj/#_address_subcommand[regarding addresses there].
You could also find information regarding the link:/httyj/#_genesis_subcommand[jcli genesis tooling].

You can generate a documented pre-generated genesis file:

[source, bash]
----
jcli genesis init
----

There are multiple parts to a genesis file:

* `blockchain_configuration`: this is a list of configuration
  parameters of the blockchain, some of which can be changed later
  via the update protocol;
* `initial:funds`: the list of initial utxos (addresses and credited value);

== Blockchain configuration options

|===
| *option* | *format* | *description* |
| `block0_date` | number | the official start time of the blockchain, in seconds since UNIX EPOCH |
| `discrimination` | string | `production` or `test` |
| `block0_consensus` | string | `bft` |
| `slot_duration` | number | the number of seconds between the creation of 2 blocks |
| `epoch_stability_depth` | number | allowed size of a fork (in number of block) |
| `consensus_leader_ids` | array | the list of the BFT leader at the beginning of the blockchain |
| `max_number_of_transactions_per_block` | number | the maximum number of transactions allowed in a block |
| `bft_slots_ratio` | number | placeholder, do not use |
| `allow_account_creation` | boolean | allow creating accounts without publishing certificate |
| `linear_fee` | object | linear fee settings, set the fee for transaction and certificate publishing |
|===

For more information about the BFT leaders in the genesis file, see
link:/httyj/#_starting_a_bft_node[Starting a BFT Blockchain]

== The initial options

Each entry can be one of 2 variants:

|===
| *variant* | *format* | *description* |
| `fund` | object | initial deposits present in the blockchain |
| `cert` | string | initial stakepool certificate |
|===
Example:

```yaml
initial:
  - fund:
      address: <address>
      value: 10000
  - cert: <certificate>
  - fund:
      address: <another address>
      value: 1001
```

The `fund` format:

|===
| *variant* | *format* | *description* |
| `address` | string | can be a link:/httyj/#_address_for_utxo[single address] or an link:/httyj/#_address_for_account[account address] (if `allow_account_creation` is set to true) |
| `value` | number | assigned value |
