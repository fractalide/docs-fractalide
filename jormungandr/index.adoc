Welcome to the Jörmungandr User Manual.

Jörmungandr is a implementation of a distributed ledger full node, written in rust, with the
initial aim to support Ouroboros type of consensus protocol.

A full node is a participant of a blockchain network, continuously making,
sending, receiving and validating blocks. Each full node in the network is responsible
to ensure the protocol is followed.

The Jörmungandr has been with us since the dawn of time. In Norse mythology the Jörmungandr fulfilled the responsibility of being _"The Midgard Serpent"_. Earlier civilizations such as the Ancient Egyptians also knew of the Jörmungandr, though differently, as the serpent that eats its tail, the _https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889.pdf[Ouroboros]_. In modern times the Jörmungandr rarely appears, if at all, but only appears during hard times when the hero within us is revealed, only to those who have the keenest sense of attention earned by hard training and only to those who wield the Fractalide sword. The Jörmungandr is one of two dragons the sword commands. If the inexperienced have yet to earn their sword, they may do so by trying to pull the below sword from their screen.
