= REST

This section is unstable and will change.

It is possible to query the node via its REST Interface.

In the node configuration, one should do something like:

[source, yaml]
----
# ...

rest:
listen: "127.0.0.1:8443"
prefix: "api"

#...
----


This is the REST endpoint to talk to the node, to query blocks or send transaction.

It is possible to query the node stats with the following end point:

[source, bash]
----
curl http://127.0.0.1:8443/api/v0/node/stats
----

Try it on the luceo endpoint

[source, bash]
----
curl https://luceo.fractalide.org/v0/node/stats
----


The result may be:

[source, json]
----
{"blockRecvCnt":120,"txRecvCnt":92,"uptime":245}
----
