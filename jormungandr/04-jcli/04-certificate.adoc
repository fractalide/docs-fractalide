Tooling for offline transaction creation

jcli certificate [subcommand]

== Certificate builder

Builds a signed certificate.

The process can be split into discreet steps after the certificate
is created.

[source, bash]
----
jcli certificate new stake-pool-registration \
  --vrf-key <vrf-public-key> --kes-key <kes-public-key> \
  [--owner <owner-public-key>] \
  --serial <node-serial> \
  <output-file>
----

If the `output-file` is omitted, the result will be written to `stdout`. Once the
certificate is ready you must sign it with the private keys of
all the owners:


[source, bash]
----
jcli certificate sign <key> <input-file> <output-file>
----
