= JCLI

Generally interfacing with the node requires the use of JCLI, which is a command line application that contains all the cryptographic functions needed to work well. JCLI is mostly meant for developers and stake pool operators. It allows offline operations:

* generating cryptographic materials for wallets and stake pools
* creating addresses, transactions and certificates
* prepare a new blockchain

and it allows simple interactions with the node:

* query stats
* send transactions and certificates
* get raw blocks and UTxOs
* etc
